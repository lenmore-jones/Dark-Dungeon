You are thrown into darkness, stumbling as you land on shaking feet. 
There is a glow, a smell of burning and a strange warmth. You look 
around trying to locate the source of the pale red light and the 
faint but strengthening smell. The room is dimly illuminated by the 
glow behind you. As you turn, the dim illumination turns with you...
always remaining behind you...very strange.  

Wait!  

What!? 

Your trousers are on fire!  

You beat franticly at your backside and put out the smoldering material. 
Phew. That was close...and getting extremely uncomfortable. There is 
now a cool draft blowing through the hole in your trousers. At least 
that is better than the heat that was increasing rapidly before. The 
fire must have been from a stray spark of magical energy, a leftover 
from the spell that bought you here.  

You are now in total darkness. 

In your pocket you feel a box of matches. You strike one. The light 
of the match flare surprises you. You look around quickly. In the dim 
light of the flickering flame, you glimpse glints of light reflected 
from the damp dripping rock walls. All too quickly the match burns 
out and you are plunged back into the dark once again. 

You strike another match. This time, you were expecting the flare and 
have time to catch sight of a pile of rags wrapped around a wooden 
handle, lying on the floor. It’s an unlit torch. Your match burns out 
and the light dies again. You have one match left. 

You sink to your knees and inch carefully over to where you saw the 
torch. Reaching out around the cold, damp floor you feel for the torch, 
hoping it is not too wet to light. 

Your fingers reach out and you grasp the torch. You stand unsteadily 
on the uneven, rocky floor. With your last remaining match, you light 
the torch. It is bright, and smoky (the smell...it reminds you of 
something...oh yes – your trousers). The room...or chamber you now 
realize...is lit by flickering light with shadows dancing over stone 
walls hung with mosses, molds and other unpleasant things. Dank, 
green-black and ominous.  To your left, a dark passage leads off to 
who-knows-where. To your right a stout oak door stands slightly ajar.  
The room on the other side, equally dark and forbidding. 
What do you do?
